# Task Analyzer - Frontend

This guide will walk you through setting up the frontend of the Task Analyzer project.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the frontend, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm**: npm comes bundled with Node.js, so installing Node.js will also install npm.

## Installation

### 1. Install Vue CLI

To get started, you'll need to install the Vue CLI globally on your system. Run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

or if you're using sudo:

```bash
sudo npm install -g @vue/cli
```

### 2. Install Project Dependencies
Once the Vue CLI is installed, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Development Server
To start the development server locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This will start the Vue development server and make the application accessible at ```http://localhost:8080```

> **Note:** Make sure to run the backend server first in order to connect this frontend to the data store. Instructions for setting up the backend can be found in the [backend repository](https://github.com/fahimHasnat/Text-Analyzer-Api).
